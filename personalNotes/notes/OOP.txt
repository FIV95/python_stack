Everything can be an object

we define the type of objects in a:
CLASS

take a tree for example it has:
ATTRIBUTES -- These are like the characteristics
      Trunk
      Leaves
      Branches
      Roots

Tree Behaviors:
METHODS -- These are like the things they can do with those characteristics
      Grows
      Sways
      Produces Fruit
      Makes Leaves
      Drop leaves

Designing classes:

Three Building types:

Barracks
      Attributes:
            X axis
            Y axis
            Health
      Methods:
            Create solidiers
Every time a barracks is created you create an Object/Instance
      Every Object/instance has the same attributes and methods as Barracks
            You can privatize certain attributes and methods
            you can also have protected attributes and methods that will be sent to children
            by default methods and attributes are public

Constructors are the blueprints for new objects/instances
Destructors are the blueprints when the object is destroyed

Say the barracks has an upgrade option:
If it gets upgraded
      the upgraded barracks can Inherit the attributes and methods from the original classes
